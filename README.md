# chat-bot

This bot has been created using [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com), it shows how to:

- Use [LUIS](https://www.luis.ai) to implement core AI capabilities
- Implement a multi-turn conversation using Dialogs
- Handle user interruptions for such things as `Help` or `Cancel`
- Prompt for and validate requests for information from the user
- Demonstrate how to handle any unexpected errors

## Prerequisites

Need to have created the bot in the Azure Portal. Also need to have used Microsoft QNA Maker in order to create knowledge base and connected that to the bot. 


# To run the bot locally
- Download the bot code from the the Azure Portal (make sure you click "Yes" when asked "Include app settings in the downloaded zip file?").
    - If you clicked "No" you will need to copy all the Application Settings properties from your App Service to your local .env file.
- Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
- Run the bot

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator

[Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the Bot Framework Emulator version 4.9.0 or greater from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases)

### Connect to the bot using Bot Framework Emulator

- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot
- Enter a Bot URL of `http://localhost:3978/api/messages`

# Deploy the bot to Azure
After creating the bot and testing it locally, you can deploy it to Azure to make it accessible from anywhere.
To learn how, see [Deploy your bot to Azure](https://aka.ms/azuredeployment) for a complete set of deployment instructions.
